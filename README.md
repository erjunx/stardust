# stardust

welcome to project stardust

let's create something in between (or include both) an ERM and factory planning, we are going to help manufacturers of all kinds to better spend their money and better manage their factory (or any production facility, even a noodle stall)

How do we start?

start with your own pull request to set up your branch, and key in your ideas. let's discuss and then merge in to the main and then execute to that.

On GitHub

let's try to get familiar with GitHub from your first pull request...

what about us
